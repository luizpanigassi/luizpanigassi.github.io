    <h1>When in need...</h1>
    <p>This document was created by yours truly to help with CSS and HTML coding.</p>

    <!-- This is the main container wrapping everything-->

    <div class="container">

        <!-- Let's talk basics here-->

        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li>Remember to ALWAYS link the CSS file to your document. Use &lt;link rel="stylesheet"
                    href="filename.css"&gt; is the basic way to do it. But remember to put the right name, dummy. </li>
                <li> Any fonts you use MUST BE LINKED. Remeber to use &ltlink href="fontlink" rel="stylesheet"&gt;, then
                    you can use it.</li>
                <li>Borders required pixel size, solidity and a color.</li>
                <li>Nice background image, right? You need to set the &lt;body&gt; to receive it in CSS. Remember to use
                    the right link.</li>
                <li>Oh shit! The background screwed my colors! Well... style them with CSS. Focus on &lt;h&gt;'s (from 1
                    to 6), and &lt;p&gt;'s.</li>
                <li>Visual code is your new god. He will autocomplete your tags, help with linkage, and it's easy to
                    find code errors. Enjoy.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Lists, go here-->

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>For lists, you can use &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt;, unordered or ordered lists. Open the tag, then insert
                the &lt;li&gt; in it, which are the List Items. You can style the lists in CSS, go crazy. If you type
                "style" between brackets you'll see a dozen things you can do to your list. I used armenian in mine,
                makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Let's talk containers -->
        <h2>Containers</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>So, you can created containers. Here's where &lt;div&gt;s can help. You can set a div, give it a class,
                then style it in CSS using borders. A nice border, with some padding, can make things separate like
                boxes, like those pretty babies here. Remember you can use border-top, border-bottom, left and right.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- This is the container of colors -->

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                To add colors, you have to use the color attribute. Then, remember, you can use the name, color
                code, or
                rgb. Here are some examples of colors you can use:
            </p>
            <div class="color-panel cool-blue">
                <p class="color-label">CoolBlue</p>
                <p class="color-hex">#2d5dcc</p>
            </div>
            <div class="color-panel red">
                <p class="color-label">IndianRed</p>
                <p class="color-hex">#CD5C5C</p>
            </div>
            <div class="color-panel green">
                <p class="color-label">MediumSeaGreen</p>
                <p class="color-hex">#3CB371</p>
            </div>
            <p>Remember, you can always use rgbA to input an alpha value, which refers to opacity.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- This is the container of fonts -->
        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Fonts are easy. Just go to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>, choose your font,
                its
                weight, copy the code, find the &lt;head&gt; section and paste it, so the fonts can be loaded. Then
                just
                enter the font-family code in CSS, and BOOM!</p>
            <p>Other codes to pay attention to in CSS are font-weight (for boldness), transform (for uppercase and
                such), size (for what again?) and style (for italics)</p>
        </div>

        <!-- This is the container of tables -->
        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Tables can be annoying. First, set the &lt;table&gt;, to wrap everything. Inside it, you need to set
                the
                &lt;thead&gt;, to set the header. Inside it, you can input the &lt;tr&gt;, which are the row. Inside
                the
                row, input the &lt;td&gt;, and each symbolizes a cell in the row, generating new columns.</p>
            <p>When you're done with the head, go for &lt;body&gt;, following the same idea of the head. Why
                separate,
                and not just input TR and TD? Because then you can style everything individually using CSS!</p>
